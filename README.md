# 🌟 Astrophel

Astrophel is a **learning project** aimed at building a simple yet structured
programming language. The goal is to explore compiler construction and gain
hands-on experience with language design, parsing, and execution.

🚀 **For now, this is just a learning experiment**—but who knows? Maybe one day
it'll evolve into something serious!

## 🔥 Inspiration

Astrophel is inspired by:

- 🎥
  [Tyler Laceby’s "How to Build a Programming Language" series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VB5TY1sIRo&list=PL_2VhOvlMk4UHGqYCLWc6GO8FaPl8fQTh)
  on YouTube.
- 📖 _Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools_ by Alfred Aho, Monica Lam,
  Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman (a.k.a. "The Dragon Book").

## 🛠 Why Dart?

The initial compiler (a.k.a. "legacy compiler") is written in **Dart**, a
language I really enjoy and feel highly productive with. If Astrophel ever
becomes something serious, the long-term plan is to transition to a
**self-hosted compiler**.

## 🌌 Features (Planned)

- **C-like syntax** 🏗
- **Two-pass lexer** with contextual analysis ✍️
- **Strongly typed system** with size-specified types (e.g., `u16`, `f32`) 📏
- **Flexible parsing and AST generation** 🌲
- **Eventually… a working compiler!** 🔧

## ✨ Status

Astrophel is still in **early development**, with work being done on the lexer
and parser. Any contributions, feedback, or GitHub stars ⭐ would be greatly
appreciated!
